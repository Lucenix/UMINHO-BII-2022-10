# UMINHO-BII-2022-10
Work done related to UMINHO/BII/2022/10, namely implementing Dvorak, Kawarabayashi and Thomas´ "Three-coloring triangle-free planar graphs in linear time" algorithm in C from scratch. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.5121.pdf)

Used and adapted an hashtable implementation done by [Carlos Machado](https://github.com/hiddenduck), [Gonçalo Sousa](https://github.com/mirelois) and I for 'Operative Systems' Course, found [here](https://github.com/mirelois/projetoSO).
